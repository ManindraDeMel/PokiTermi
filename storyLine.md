In the peaceful town of Palletville, renowned Pokémon Professor Oak is facing an unusual predicament.
Last night, he celebrated a bit too much and woke up with a fuzzy memory. Not only does he forget 
where he placed his research notes, but he also can't remember how to move around the town he's
lived in for years. He found himself in an unfamiliar part of the region, 
surrounded by Pokémon specimens and mysterious gadgets.

As players begin the game, they take on the role of Professor Oak, who starts his journey in a 
randomly generated starting location. The town layout, landmarks, and even the locations of 
Pokémon are different each time you play. Your challenge is not only to regain your memory 
but also to adapt to the ever-changing world around you.
